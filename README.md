## Persona 1 (Aszliah)
Mrs. Jones is a 30-year-old elementary school math teacher in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania who primarily teaches children in grades 3-5. She graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a bachelor’s degree in primary education and went on to earn her teacher state certification. With the rise of technology, her school has been making efforts to incorporate technology as a supplement in the classroom and allows teachers to rent out laptop carts for their students to use during class. Students are walked through the basics of how to use the laptop at the start of the school year, although Mrs. Jones’s students tend to already have experience working with laptops at home.
With Mrs. Jones’s background, she knows how important it is to keep children engaged in the classroom and is constantly looking for fun ways to reinforce her material. Unfortunately, with the integration of technology, she has begun catching some of her students playing games in separate tabs instead of staying on-task during class. She tries looking online for educational games that she can incorporate into the classroom, but websites like coolmathgames.com are riddled with ads and other distracting links. Luckily, she manages to find Dungeons & Dragons & Digits, a fantasy game that provides valuable math practice in the fun, imaginative setting of Dungeons & Dragons instead of plain old worksheets. Her students seem excited to try it!
## Persona 2 (Priya)
Sarah is a forty-two year old single mom with a lot on her plate: a 9-to-5 job, three kids, and a mortgage that won’t pay itself. She works as a journalist at her local newspaper and relies on her phone calculator for even the simplest of multiplications. She graduated from Rutgers University with a degree in English and lives in the suburbs of Vancouver, with no family around to help raise her kids. Sarah recently found out that her oldest boy, Matty, age 6, isn’t doing so well in his math classes. In fact, his teachers say that all Matty does in class is ask to play computer games! Sarah’s busy juggling her other kids and her job, and she doesn’t have the money to invest in a private tutor. She knows how important it is for Matty to get his subtraction skills down, but she’s finding it hard to keep him engaged in learning, especially when he’s getting so good at the video games he’s playing.

Fortunately, Sarah saw an ad for Dungeons & Dragons & Digits, a fun math game that encourages kids to hone their math skills while completing an interactive adventure. Matty loves playing video games, and this might just give Sarah a way to teach him subtraction without him getting bored. Matty’s willing to give it a shot, especially because Dungeons & Dragons looks so cool! 

## Persona 3 (Quentin)
Bob is an 18 year old college freshman who enjoys a good math problem almost as much as he enjoys a quality game of D&D with his friends. Unfortunately, there are few products out there that can really satisfy his desire to multiply right after rolling the dice. He currently attends California State University and is working towards a degree in applied mathematics. 

Our product will combine math and Dungeons and Dragons fun to create a game that truly has it all for both fantasy and problem solving lovers.

## Persona 4 (Ryan)
Johnny, age 9, is a fourth grade student living in Miami, Florida with his mother, Lisa. He loves video games and movies, especially those in the fantasy category. He’s been struggling in school lately because he gets easily bored and distracted with lessons and homework, so he’s falling behind the rest of his classmates academically. Lisa is concerned about his performance in school, but she can’t find a way to get him interested in learning, so she wants to find a product that will combine his love for fantasy and video games with learning.

Johnny has a computer at home, and he knows the basics of computers and how to use simple GUIs, but he struggles with more complicated programs that aren’t clearly explained. He loses interest in programs that aren’t aesthetically pleasing, and his primary goal is to have fun. Johnny loves Dungeons and Dragons, and he is very excited to play Dungeons & Dragons & Digits, which combines his love for fantasy and video games. He’s not very excited about the learning aspect of the game, but he’s willing to try it out if the game is fun.
