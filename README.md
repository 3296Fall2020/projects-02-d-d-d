# Dungeons & Dragons & Digits
An educational twist on a text-based RPG.
 
# Vision Statement
Dungeons & Dragons & Digits is a text-based, story-driven video game that incorporates math quizzes and lessons into the popular fantasy game Dungeons and Dragons, geared towards elementary school students, grades 1-5, who like video games and are in need of extra math education and practice. Unlike other video games and learning platforms, our product provides a fully immersive Dungeons and Dragons fantasy experience with math quizzes and lessons that teach students in a fun and interactive way.

# Project Overview
This standalone project aims to create a Java-developed, text-based RPG, based on the popular fantasy game, Dungeons and Dragons. The game will contain small math quizzes embedded within the gameplay in order to provide extra math practice to children in grades 1-5 in a way that is fun and captures the userâ€™s attention. The game will also log player statistics, which the player will be able to view and export to a file. In addition, the game will feature a multiplayer component that will allow the user to store save data on a server, maintain their progress across multiple devices, and compare scores with friends and other users.
